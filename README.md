# VirtualOulu-Web-Unity
Web build of VirtualOulu

(Was earlier OuluOldFBX). 

Unity scene with an old version of the University city model aggregate FBX. New system is coming up but this used for web publishing now.

Uses only a (small) portion of the model to fit in graphics memory with WebGL. This serves also to test web publishing memory use limits on different platforms etc.
